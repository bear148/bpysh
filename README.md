# THIS IS A COMPLETE BEAR-SHELL REWRITE
The previous project was put into one file with over 3000 lines and LOTS of repition. This made it incredibly hard to work on and maintain and I
eventually lost interested and motivation to try and maintain such a terrible code base. So, I am rewriting it from the ground up with more
knowledge and the usage of newer Python 3.12 features. The previous Bear-Shell was written in Python 3.9 or something around that.

## Bear-Shell will now be renamed to bpysh (bears py shell)
